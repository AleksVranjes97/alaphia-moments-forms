                <p></p>
                <p>There will be times when you have the time and desire for deep introspection, and you will want to take your time with the tool, and reflect deeply. There will be other times when you want to have a quick check-in with yourself, but have neither the time nor desire to reflect deeply. Both of these sides of the continuum are part of the Alaphia experience and both have value. Understand that your pace and depth will naturally vary over time, and this variability is a normal part of your personal growth journey.</p>
